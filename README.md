## How it works

This application's name is Healfy, it was our project for the contest "HackHeroes 2020". The program was meant to ease contact of patients with doctors through special website, on which patients could register to online visitations with webcams on, have live insight in their prescription, view top doctors according to other users and much more. We didn't win anything with it, but it was quite interesting project nonetheless


## Users functionalites

Depending on your account role you have different functionalities on website:

* **Doctors** : Have insights on current patients health data like mood, blood pressure, amount of sleep and so on. They can also write prescriptions
* **Patients** : Can view all registered in the app doctors, rate them, set basic health data about themselves like blood pressure. They are able to see written prescriptions with exact does portion and times of application of medicament. They can see in their calendar scheduled online visits with doctors 


## Frontend specification

Frontend part of program was written in React.js, in this repository under branch "janek" you can see latest development code of it. More information about how to run the project [here](#How-to-run). As it was said in the previous section, some parts of website vary depending on users role, below are screenshots of selected sites

## Comments and adnotations

* Application as a whole isn't working. We divided our attention so that backend and frontend could have been developed simultaneously, but in the end we were lacking time, so front and back arent properly fused with each other
* This README, especially [How it works](#How-it-works) part describes ideal situation with all of our ideas completed, but unfortunately we did not manage to implement everything on time

## Used technologies
* Frontend - React.js
* Backend Django API
* [REACT-CALENDAR by Wojciech Maj](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/)

## How to run
* **Frontend** : Full documentation can be viewed in branch "janek" under README.md
*  **Backend** : lorem ipsum
